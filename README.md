## ðŸ“˜ Question 2: DSA Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such thatthey add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

## ðŸ’¡ JavaScript Solution

```js
function twoSum(nums, target) {
    if (!Array.isArray(nums)) throw new Error("First argument must be an array");
    const map = new Map();

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.has(complement)) {
            return [map.get(complement), i];
        }
        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }

    throw new Error("No two numbers add up to the target");
}

console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9));
```

## ðŸ“˜ Question 3: MongoDB Aggregation Consider a MongoDB collection named sales with documents structured as follows:

json:
{
"_id": ObjectId("..."),
"date": ISODate("2024-06-15T00:00:00Z"),
"store": "Store A",
"items": [
{
"name": "item1",
"quantity": 5,
"price": 10.0
},
{
"name": "item2",
"quantity": 3,
"price": 20.0
}
]
}
Your task is to write an aggregation pipeline to calculate the total revenue generated by each store for each month,
along with the average price of items sold. The result should be sorted first by store and then by month (in ascending
order).

## ðŸ’¡ Aggregation  Solution

```Aggregation
db.sales.aggregate([
{
$unwind: "$items"
},
{
$group: {
_id: {
store: "$store",
month: { $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m", date: "$date" } }
},
totalRevenue: {
$sum: { $multiply: ["$items.quantity", "$items.price"] }
},
totalPrice: { $sum: "$items.price" },
count: { $sum: 1 }
}
},
{
$project: {
store: "$_id.store",
month: "$_id.month",
totalRevenue: 1,
averagePrice: { $divide: ["$totalPrice", "$count"] },
_id: 0
}
},
{ $sort: { store: 1, month: 1 } }
])
```

## ðŸ“˜ Question 4: React Build a Dynamic To-Do List Application in React.

Objective:
Create a React application that allows users to manage a to-do list with the following features:

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks by all, completed, and pending
- Persist tasks in the local storage so that they are retained after a page refresh
